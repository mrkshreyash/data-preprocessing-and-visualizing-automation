# Data Preprocessing and Visulizing Automation
(This project is not final. It needs some features that will be added in future.)<br>
Using this main.py you can run all commands of initial data science like preprocessing, information, null values count and most important data visulization using different graphs.


1. <b> housing.csv </b> is a sample data which is used to test the main.py script. You can use your dataset also. Just you have to enter path to the dataset. <br>

2. <b> main.py </b> the first input is "path to the dataset" in this you have to parse the path of your dataset. Or the dataset is existing in same directory where your <b>main.py</b> script is present then you can directly parse the name of the dataset.<br>

<br><hr>
<b><i>for eg.</i></b> 

<br>Run the main program
```python
python main.py
```

<br>
Please Enter your data path :  <b>housing.csv</b>

<br>
<hr>

And for the rest of the inputs you can parse just index number of the options for output. <br> And for the graphing you have to parse the axis names containing in the dataset.
